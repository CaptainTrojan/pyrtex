Example 1: Batch Business Card Text Extraction

This example demonstrates the power of batch processing by extracting contact
information from multiple business cards with different designs and layouts.
It shows how PyRTex can process various formats in a single batch and extract
consistent structured data regardless of visual design differences.

IMPORTANT: This example also demonstrates proper result handling. Results from
BigQuery may not preserve the original submission order, so we use request keys
to map results back to the correct input files.
